            Design thinking is an iterative process in which you seek to understand your users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions which you can prototype and test. The overall goal is to identify alternative strategies and solutions that are not instantly apparent with your initial level of understanding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Design thinking is more than just a process; it opens up an entirely new way to think, and it offers a collection of hands-on methods to help you apply this new mindset.
            <br><br><strong>Principles of Design Thinking:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The Human Rule</strong> 
              <br> All Design is social in nature
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Ambiguity Rule </strong>
              <br> Ambiguity is inevitable - experiment at the limits of your knowledge
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>All Design is Redesign </strong>
              <br> Technology and Social Circumstances may change
but Basic Human Needs remain unchanged
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Tangibility Rule</strong> 
              <br> Prototypes help to make ideas tangible, enabling designers to communicate them effectively

          The impact effort matrix is a visual tool designed to help teams prioritize tasks and maximize their efficiency while ensuring that their goals are aligned. Set up as a four-quadrant grid, the matrix organizes tasks into four categories: Quick wins: Projects with maximum impact that require minimal effort.
